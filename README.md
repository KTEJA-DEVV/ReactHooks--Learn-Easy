<h1>UseState</h1>
<p>The useState hook in React is a tool that lets you add and manage changing data (state) inside a functional component.

In simple words â€” it helps your app remember values and update the UI when those values change.

ðŸ‘‰ Example: If you click a button to increase a number or show/hide something, useState keeps track of that change.</p>

<h1>useEffect</h1>
<p>The useEffect hook in React lets you run code after the component renders â€” like fetching data, updating the DOM, or setting up timers.

In simple words â€” itâ€™s used to handle side effects in your component (things that happen outside the normal rendering).</p>
